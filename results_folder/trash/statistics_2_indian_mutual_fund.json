Correlation Strength: 0.805 is very close to 1, suggesting a strong linear relationship between the Total Expense Ratios (TER) of Regular and Direct plans.\n2. Meaning: As the Total Expense Ratio for Regular plans increases, the Total Expense Ratio for Direct plans tends to increase proportionally.\n3. Practical Interpretation: \n   - The expense structures of Regular and Direct plans are closely aligned\n   - Direct plans consistently maintain lower expense ratios\n   - The similar movement suggests that underlying cost factors affect both plan types similarly\n\nCorrelation Scale:\n- 0.805 is considered a strong positive correlation\n- Close to 1 indicates a near-linear relationship\n- Demonstrates that while Direct plans have lower TER, they follow a similar pattern to Regular plans\n\nThis correlation provides valuable insight into the expense ratio dynamics across different mutual fund schemes in the dataset."

Expense Ratio Differences:\n   - Mean Regular Plan TER: 1.1827%\n   - Mean Direct Plan TER: 0.4822%\n   - Average Difference: 0.7005 percentage points\n\n3. Consistent Pattern:\n   - Regular Plans consistently have higher Total Expense Ratios compared to Direct Plans.\n   - This is typical in the mutual fund industry, as Regular Plans include distribution costs and commissions.\n\n4. Variability in TER Differences:\n   - Minimum Difference: -1.04 percentage points (rare cases where Direct Plan TER is higher)\n   - Maximum Difference: 2.00 percentage points\n   - Median Difference: 0.65 percentage points\n\nThe strong correlation and consistent pattern suggest that while the expense structures differ between Regular and Direct Plans, they follow similar underlying cost dynamics across different mutual fund schemes."
