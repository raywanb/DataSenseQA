Calculation Method: The column represents the average arrest probability for each crime type by calculating the mean of the 'Arrest' column grouped by 'Primary Type'.\n\n2. Key Observations:\n- Some crime types have 100% arrest rates (e.g., Gambling, Liquor Law Violation)\n- Some have very low arrest rates (e.g., Human Trafficking at 0%, Intimidation at 3.7%)\n- More serious crimes like Homicide have a moderate arrest rate (37.5%)\n\n3. Limitations:\n- It's an aggregate statistic that doesn't account for:\n  * Individual case complexities\n  * Variations in evidence\n  * Law enforcement resources\n  * Reporting rates\n\n4. Interpretation Caution:\n- This metric provides a broad trend but should not be used as a definitive predictor of arrest likelihood in specific cases\n- It offers insights into law enforcement arrest patterns across different crime types\n\n5. Potential Uses:\n- Broad trend analysis\n- Resource allocation insights\n- Understanding general law enforcement effectiveness for different crime types\n\nThe value is statistically meaningful but should be interpreted carefully, considering the contextual limitations of such an aggregate measure.",
