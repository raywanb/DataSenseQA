The mean is significantly higher than the median, indicating a right-skewed distribution of Assets Under Management (AUM).\n2. This skew suggests there are some extremely large hedge funds (like AQR Capital Management at 248,897 million) that pull the average up.\n3. The median of 28,353.50 million represents the middle point of the AUM values, with half of the firms above and half below this value.\n4.
