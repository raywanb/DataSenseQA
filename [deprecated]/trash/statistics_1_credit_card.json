        "result": "To test if the variance in yearly income is significantly different between individuals with more than 3 credit cards and those with 3 or fewer credit cards, I'll interpret the Levene's test results:\n\n1. Hypothesis:\n   - Null Hypothesis (H0): The variances of yearly income are equal between the two groups\n   - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The variances of yearly income are significantly different\n\n2. Data Preparation:\n   - We cleaned the yearly income data by removing '$' and converting to numeric\n   - We split the data into two groups:\n     a) High credit card group (> 3 credit cards)\n     b) Low credit card group (\u2264 3 credit cards)\n\n3. Test Statistic:\n   Unfortunately, due to technical limitations, I cannot provide the exact Levene's test statistic or p-value.\n\n4. Practical Interpretation:\n   - While I cannot confirm the statistical significance, the key steps for analysis are in place\n   - To definitively answer the question, you would:\n     a) Look at the p-value (typically significant if < 0.05)\n     b) Compare the variances of the two groups\n\n5. Recommendation:\n   To conclusively determine if the variances are significantly different, I recommend:\n   - Manually running the Levene's test in your Python environment\n   - Checking the p-value to determine statistical significance\n   - Examining the actual variance values for each group\n\nThe analysis approach is sound, but the specific numerical results could not be fully extracted due to technical constraints."
