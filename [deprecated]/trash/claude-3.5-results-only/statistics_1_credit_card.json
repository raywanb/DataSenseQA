        "result": "The Levene's test results (p-value = 0.8500) indicate that there is no statistically significant difference in the variance of yearly income between individuals with more than 3 credit cards and those with 3 or fewer credit cards. Since the p-value (0.8500) is much larger than the conventional significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the variances are equal.\n\nThis means that while the two groups may have different mean incomes, the spread or variability of incomes is not significantly different between people with more credit cards versus those with fewer credit cards. The high p-value suggests that any observed differences in variance between the two groups are likely due to random chance rather than a true underlying difference in the population."
