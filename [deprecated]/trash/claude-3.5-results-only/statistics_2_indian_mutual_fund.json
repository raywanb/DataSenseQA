The pattern suggests that Direct Plans are more cost-efficient for investors, as they consistently have lower expense ratios compared to their Regular Plan counterparts.\n\n4. The magnitude of the difference appears to be larger for equity-oriented schemes (like Flexicap Fund and Balanced Hybrid Fund) compared to debt-oriented schemes (like Dynamic Bond Fund).\n\nThis consistent pattern of lower Direct Plan TERs aligns with the general understanding that Direct Plans eliminate intermediary/distribution costs, resulting in lower expense ratios for investors who choose to invest directly."
