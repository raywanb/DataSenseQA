There is only a weak positive correlation between tumor size (radius/area) and symmetry measures (correlations ranging from 0.144 to 0.164), suggesting that larger tumors don't strongly deviate from symmetry patterns compared to smaller ones.\n\n2. However, when examining size categories more specifically:\n   - Large tumors show slightly higher mean symmetry values (0.189) compared to small (0.181) and medium (0.174) tumors\n   - The worst-case symmetry measures also increase with size (from 0.280 in small tumors to 0.307 in large tumors)\n   - The standard deviation of symmetry measures increases slightly with tumor size, indicating more variability in symmetry maintenance in larger tumors\n\n3. The strong correlation (0.700) between symmetry_mean and symmetry_worst suggests that basic symmetry patterns are maintained regardless of tumor size, though with some deterioration in more severe cases.\n\nIn conclusion, while larger tumors do show slightly different morphological patterns in terms of symmetry, the differences are not dramatic. Larger tumors tend to have marginally higher symmetry values and more variability in symmetry maintenance, but the basic symmetry constraints appear to be largely preserved regardless of tumor size. This suggests that the biological mechanisms governing tumor symmetry are relatively robust across different tumor sizes."
